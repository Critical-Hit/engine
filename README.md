This is the project's website on Github Pages. It's made with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). Most of it is a fairly straightforward Jekyll website, except the \_documentation directory. This a directory used for the generated Doxygen documentation. The documentation has to be generated with the provided Doxyfile and files in the `doxyfile` directory in order to insert the required YAML front-matter. Oh, and the Doxygen parts of `css/main.css` are full of poisonous serpents. Have fun!
